## Project Objective
This project aims to design and implement a sophisticated weekly dashboard for credit card operations. This dashboard will provide real-time data analytics capabilities, offering stakeholders up-to-date insights into critical performance metrics and emerging trends. By providing a comprehensive view of the credit card portfolio, the dashboard will empower stakeholders to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Operational Efficiency, Analyze Trends, and Strategic Decision Making.

Ultimately, this dashboard will serve as a vital tool for enhancing the overall management and performance of credit card operations, ensuring that stakeholders can make well-informed decisions based on accurate and timely information.
